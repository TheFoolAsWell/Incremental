# Technomancy

Technomancy is an [incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) game about managing the production of a large variety of resources. It's inspired by [Kittens Game](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/) and [Sandcastle Builder](http://castle.chirpingmustard.com/castle.html) mainly, but draws mechanics and inspiration from a wide variety of other incremental games. 

Play it [here](https://fuzzything44.github.io/Incremental/Technomancy/). To start, click on "Bank" to buy your first bank and start earning income. You can then use that money to buy more banks or other resource generators. If a generator runs out of input resources it will turn off (but you can turn it back on once you have enough input resources again). You can always mouse over a resource in the left column to get a list of what's producing and using the resource. 

Note: This is written in TypeScript and transpiled to JavaScript, so look at the .ts files instead of the .js files for the source code.
